# This is a web scraper for incidecoder website. This website has information on many products. When you click on a product name it'll show the description of the product, the ingredients it has and an explanation for most ingredients. I was inspired to create this tool to better filter out specific products in incidecoder because this website doesn't have an indepth filter tool.
